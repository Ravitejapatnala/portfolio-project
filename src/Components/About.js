            <p>Hello Everyone! I am learning frontend development and right now I am in React Module. I wish that I 
                will land a good job in a good company with good package very soon. As god is my bloody witness, he 
                knows how hard I'm working right now and I pray him to bless me for what I'm wishing for. Thank you.</p>
